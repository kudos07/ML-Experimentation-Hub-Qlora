## 📖 What’s Inside
The blog walks through QLoRA step by step:

1. Introduction to QLoRA  
2. Problem Statement – Why LoRA is not enough  
3. Key Definitions (LoRA, quantization, adapters)  
4. How QLoRA combines quantization + LoRA  
5. Technical Innovations (NF4, double quantization, paged optimizers)  
6. Results and scaling to LLaMA-65B on a single GPU  
7. Hyperparameters: rank `r` and scaling `α`  
8. Benchmarks and Guanaco results  
9. Conclusion
